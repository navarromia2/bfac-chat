# Abstract
Attacks by armed groups in 2021 threatened Burkina Faso's progress in child health. We quantified the impact of terrorist attacks on child healthcare-seeking patterns in Kossi, Burkina Faso. We used healthcare facility surveillance data to explore whether terrorism impacted the number of monthly facility visits and whether effects differed by proximity or diagnosis. Healthcare utilization rates for sick-child visits decreased during violent months (IRR for violent months = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.65, 0.98), regardless of proximity (IRR for locally violent months = 0.72 [0.57, 0.89]; IRR for distantly violent months = 0.84 [0.68, 1.04]) and visit type, with terrorism having the largest impact on diarrhea (IRR for diarrhea visits in violent months = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.54, 0.86) and malaria (IRR for malaria visits in violent months = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.88) visits. Results can help optimize mobile treatment efforts during terrorist events.
